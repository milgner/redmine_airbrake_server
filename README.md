# Airbrake Server for Redmine

An implementation of the [Airbrake](http://airbrakeapp.com) (formerly known as Hoptoad) protocol v2 for Redmine which automatically creates issues from notices submitted from your applications notifier.
Inspired by and loosely based on the [Hoptoad server by Jan Schulz-Hofen](https://github.com/yeah/redmine_hoptoad_server)


## Installation

Install the hpricot gem, then install the plugin into Redmine [as usual](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins).
Now go to _Administration -> Settings -> Incoming emails_ and, if neccessary, check the box _Enable WS for incoming emails_ and generate an API key. This is the key you will need in the next step to configure your notifier.


## Client-Configuration

For a Rails application, just setup the Hoptoad notifier as usual, then modify `config/initializers/hoptoad.rb` according to your needs using this template:

	HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
	  config.api_key = {:project => 'redmine_project_identifier',    # the identifier you specified for your project in Redmine
	                    :tracker => 'Bug',                           # the name of your desired tracker
	                    :api_key => 'redmine_api_key',               # the key you generated in the previous step
	                    :category => 'Development',                  # the name of a ticket category (optional.)
                      :fixed_version => '25'                       # the default version (use is instead of name, optional.)
	                    :assigned_to => 'admin',                     # the login of a user the ticket should get assigned to by default (optional.)
	                    :login => 'airbrake',                        # the login who should be displayed as author of the tickets. Defaults to anonymous.
	                    :reopen => 'production',                     # will only reopen if the error occurs on the specified environment. Defaults to all, optional.
	                    :priority => 5                               # the default priority (use id instead of name, optional.)
	                   }.to_yaml
	  config.host = 'my_redmine_host.com'                            # the hostname your Redmine runs at
	  config.port = 443                                              # the port your Redmine runs at
	  config.secure = true                                           # sends data to your server via SSL (optional.)
	end

That's it. You may run `rake hoptoad:test` to generate a test issue.
If it doesn't work, check your logs and configuration, then [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/milgner/redmine_airbrake_server/issues)
